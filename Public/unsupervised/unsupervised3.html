    <h1>Great job!</h1>
    <p>You just experienced what unsupervised learning is like - finding patterns without being given labels or correct answers.</p>
    <p>Think about how you found the patterns. Did you notice similarities? Did you group things together? That's what unsupervised AI does!</p>
    <p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>, Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns, groups similar data together, and discovers structure in data - all without being told what the "right" answer is. The AI explores the data and learns what patterns exist naturally.</p>
