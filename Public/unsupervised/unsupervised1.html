    <h1>Unsupervised Learning</h1>
    <p>Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with data that has NO labels or correct answers. The AI must find patterns, groups, or structures on its own.</p>
    <p>🔁 The key difference: No labels, no "correct" answers to compare against</p>
    <p>Common tasks in unsupervised learning:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clustering: Grouping similar items together</li>
        <li>Pattern Recognition: Finding hidden patterns in data</li>
        <li>Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying complex data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: If you show an AI 1000 photos with NO labels, it might discover on its own that some photos are of cats, some are dogs, and some are birds - just by finding patterns in the pixels.</p>
    <p>Now let's play a game where you find patterns without being told what to look for</p>
