    <h1>Congratulations! You've completed Unsupervised Learning!</h1>
    <p>You've learned how unsupervised AI models work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They work with unlabeled data (no correct answers provided)</li>
        <li>They find patterns and structures on their own</li>
        <li>They group similar items together (clustering)</li>
        <li>They discover hidden relationships in data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key takeaway: Unsupervised learning doesn't need labeled examples - it discovers patterns naturally by exploring the data.</p>
    <p>Ready to learn about reinforcement learning?</p>
