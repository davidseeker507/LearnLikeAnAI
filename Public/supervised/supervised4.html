    <h1>Congratulations! You've completed Supervised Learning!</h1>
    <p>You've learned how supervised AI models work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They learn from labeled examples</li>
        <li>They make predictions and compare to correct answers</li>
        <li>They adjust their parameters to reduce error</li>
        <li>They repeat this process millions of times to improve</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key takeaway: Supervised learning requires labeled data (input-output pairs) to train the model.</p>
