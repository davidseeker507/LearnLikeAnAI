    <h1>Great job!</h1>
    <p>The reason I gave you that game was because I want you to think on how you knew the answers to those questions.</p>
    <p>Is it because you understand math or patterns?</p>
    <h2>The Puzzle Pattern Explained:</h2>
    <p>The answer to each question wasn't the mathematical result - it was the <strong>sum of all digits</strong> in the question!</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"What is 12 + 34?" → Answer is 1+2+3+4 = <strong>10</strong> (not 46)</li>
        <li>"What is 56 - 23?" → Answer is 5+6+2+3 = <strong>16</strong> (not 33)</li>
        <li>"What is 123 + 456?" → Answer is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = <strong>21</strong> (not 579)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You had to discover this pattern by comparing your answers to the correct ones, just like a supervised AI model learns patterns from labeled examples!</p>
    <p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>, Supervised AIs learn by making a prediction, comparing it to the correct answer (the label), measuring how wrong they were, and then adjusting their internal parameters to reduce that error. Repeating this process across many labeled examples teaches the AI the patterns needed to make better predictions. </p>
