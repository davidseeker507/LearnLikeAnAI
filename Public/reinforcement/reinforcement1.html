    <h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is when an AI learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad actions.</p>
    <p>🔁 The reinforcement learning loop:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The AI takes an action in an environment</li>
        <li>The environment gives feedback (reward or penalty)</li>
        <li>The AI learns which actions lead to rewards</li>
        <li>The AI adjusts its strategy to maximize rewards</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Think of it like training a dog - you give treats (rewards) for good behavior and ignore or correct (penalties) for bad behavior. Over time, the dog learns what actions get rewards.</p>
    <p>Now let's play a game where you learn through rewards and penalties</p>

        <p>
            Reinforcement learning is a way to train AI by letting it learn from experience, similar to how people or animals learn by trial and error. The AI, called an agent, interacts with an environment by observing what is happening, choosing an action, and then receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. If an action leads to a good outcome, the agent is rewarded; if it leads to a bad outcome, it is penalized. Over many attempts, the agent learns which actions are better by trying to maximize the total reward it receives over time. Unlike other types of learning where the AI is given correct answers, reinforcement learning allows the AI to discover good strategies on its own through repeated interaction and feedback.
