    <h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is when an AI learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad actions.</p>
    <p>🔁 The reinforcement learning loop:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The AI takes an action in an environment</li>
        <li>The environment gives feedback (reward or penalty)</li>
        <li>The AI learns which actions lead to rewards</li>
        <li>The AI adjusts its strategy to maximize rewards</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Think of it like training a dog - you give treats (rewards) for good behavior and ignore or correct (penalties) for bad behavior. Over time, the dog learns what actions get rewards.</p>
    <p>Now let's play a game where you learn through rewards and penalties</p>
