    <h1>Congratulations! You've completed Reinforcement Learning!</h1>
    <p>You've learned how reinforcement learning works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI learns through trial and error</li>
        <li>Actions receive rewards or penalties</li>
        <li>AI adjusts strategy to maximize rewards</li>
        <li>Learning happens through interaction with environment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key takeaway: Reinforcement learning doesn't need labeled data - it learns by exploring actions and discovering which ones lead to the best outcomes.</p>
    <p>You've now learned about all three main types of AI learning!</p>
