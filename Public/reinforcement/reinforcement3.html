    <h1>Great job!</h1>
    <p>You just experienced reinforcement learning - learning through rewards and penalties!</p>
    <p>Think about how you learned which actions to take. Did you notice that certain actions gave you rewards? Did you start choosing those actions more often? That's exactly how reinforcement learning works!</p>
    <p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>, Reinforcement learning is about learning through interaction with an environment. The AI tries different actions, receives feedback (rewards or penalties), and gradually learns which actions maximize its rewards. It's like learning to play a game by playing it over and over.</p>
