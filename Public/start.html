        <p>You are a new AI model that is just starting to learn. You will be put in different situations that AI models face and you will learn from them.</p>
        <p>Don't worry you don't need to have any prior knowledge of AI to play this game.</p>
        <p>Let's start by learning about the different types of AI models.</p>
        <p>There are three main types of AI models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervised Learning</li>
            <li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Supervised Learning is when the AI model is trained on a dataset with labeled examples.</p>
        <p>Unsupervised Learning is when the AI model is trained on a dataset without labeled examples.</p>
        <p>Reinforcement Learning is when the AI model is trained on a dataset by rewarding it for good behavior and punishing it for bad behavior.</p>
        <p>Let's start by learning about Supervised Learning.</p>
        <p>Supervised Learning is when the AI model is trained on a dataset with labeled examples.</p>
        <p>The AI model will learn to predict the label of a new example based on the examples in the dataset.</p>
